Many people find it difficult to access timely, high-quality healthcare, particularly in
rural or underdeveloped locations. Routine cases might overwhelm healthcare
facilities, resulting in longer wait times and decreased productivity. Delaying diagnosis
and treatment may have an adverse impact on the outcome in terms of health. There
may be a shortage of medical professionals in some areas. and expensive healthcare
costs.

Using the Deep Learning and Python Django frameworks, my project, "Medi Scan," is
a web application that can diagnose potential diseases, offer medical information, and
recommend treatments.

Early disease detection can be facilitated by analyzing medical scans, which enables
timely intervention and treatment planning. lowering the requirement for physical
visits to medical facilities and boosting the availability of healthcare services.
Customers' financial burden can be lessened by providing a more cost-effective
alternative to standard medical consultations, particularly for diagnostic imaging.
Provide consumers with useful information, an explanation of medical scans, and
suggested interventions to help them understand their health issues and how to take
better care of themselves.
